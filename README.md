# Turtle-Pattern-Generation

Turtle is a pre-installed library in python that acts as a virtual canvas used to create pictures, graphics, and games. It provides onscreen pen to draw different shapes. 
It is primarily designed to introduce programming to children. 
Here in this jupyter notebook, I have generated some interesting patterns. Take a look!
